            <h1>My Journey: From Curiosity to Code</h1>
            <br />
            <p>It all began when I was just 10 years old, innocently tapping away at my mother's phone. Like most kids, I was drawn to the world of apps and websites, exploring everything from games to educational content. But one thought stuck with me: <i>How were these websites and apps created?</i> I couldn't shake the question. I knew they didn't just appear by magic, so I decided to go on a quest to understand the magic behind them.</p>
            <p>I turned to the internet, a vast sea of information, and after hours of searching, I stumbled upon something that changed everything: <i>coding</i>. The concept was mind-blowing. I learned that coding was the art and science of creating the very websites I used every day. But the more I dove in, the more questions arose. What languages were these coders using? What was Web Development? What exactly did it take to build something as cool as the apps and websites I was glued to?</p>
            <p>Driven by curiosity, I went deeper into the world of programming. Through hours of online tutorials, free resources, and countless blog posts, I learned about the different languages used in web development—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. It was like unlocking a new language that opened doors to endless possibilities. Over time, I narrowed my focus to web development, fascinated by the idea of creating websites and shaping online experiences.</p>
            <p>At first, I didn’t have the tools many aspiring developers have. My only “tool” was my mother’s old mobile phone. Yet, that didn't stop me. Armed with my newfound knowledge, I began experimenting with simple websites. I would tweak templates, design pages, and get a feel for the basics. The process was a bit clunky, but I was determined to learn. After months of creating tiny websites with my basic skills, I couldn’t wait to show my father the results. It wasn’t much, but it was mine—something I had built on my own.</p>
            <p>Years went by, and by the time I was 15, my skills had improved significantly. My father, recognizing my dedication, decided to get me a personal laptop. It felt like a turning point—a moment where the path I had been dreaming about suddenly became clearer. I finally had the right tools to really dive into my craft. No more using just a phone—I was ready to take my coding to the next level.</p>
            <p>From 10 to 14, I had learned everything I could from the internet and free resources. But turning 15 marked a pivotal moment in my journey. I was no longer just dabbling in coding; I was serious about it. I threw myself into learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), a powerful combination of technologies that would help me build full-stack applications. With every project, my skills grew, and I began to feel more confident in my abilities.</p>
            <p>Now, at 15, I'm creating this very portfolio as a testament to everything I’ve learned and how far I’ve come. This portfolio is more than just a project—it's a reflection of my journey from a curious child playing on a mobile phone to a passionate web developer ready to take on the world. I’ve come a long way, but this is just the beginning. The journey ahead is filled with endless possibilities, and I’m excited to see where it takes me.</p>
