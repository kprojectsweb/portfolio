            <br />
            <p>My goal has been shaped by a recent conversation of my family to another family in our close friendship, and it has solidified my focus for the future. One day, while visiting close relatives, my aunt asked my mother what I was doing nowadays. Without hesitation, my mother proudly said, “He’s a successful web development student.” This sparked an interesting conversation, and my aunt suggested that I should aim to be ready for IIT, which caught my attention. My father, who has always been supportive, immediately added, “I will help him clear IIT once he clears his 10th grade.”</p>
            <p>That moment had a lasting impact on me. Until then, I had been focused on honing my skills in web development and pursuing my passion for coding. But this conversation made me realize that I could aim for something even greater—attending one of the most prestigious institutions in India, IIT.</p>
            <p>My goal now is to clear my 10th-grade exams with excellent results and then pursue a path that leads to IIT, specifically to the renowned coaching institutes in Kota that are famous for their rigorous preparation for IIT entrance exams. I see this as a way to challenge myself academically and sharpen my problem-solving skills, while also gaining the kind of technical knowledge that will allow me to further my career in technology.</p>
            <p>While I’m deeply passionate about web development, I believe that studying at IIT will allow me to expand my knowledge in fields like computer science and engineering, which are closely tied to my interests. I want to merge my love for coding with a solid academic foundation so that I can work on high-impact technologies and contribute to solving real-world problems through innovation.</p>
            <p>In the long run, my goal is to be part of the tech community, working on cutting-edge projects and contributing to the evolution of technology. I believe that IIT will provide me with the tools, network, and knowledge I need to not only become a better developer but also to make a difference in the tech industry.</p>
            <p>This is just the beginning of a long journey, but I’m ready for the challenges ahead and excited about the possibilities that lie in the future.</p>
